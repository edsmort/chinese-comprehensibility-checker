# Chinese Comprehensibility Checker (CCC)

## What it does

Given an srt file of a chinese show or movie and an optional list of known words, it:
- Tells you what percentage of the subtitles are comprised of words you donâ€™t know (as defined by your list of known words)
- Lists the unknown words
- If a list of known words is not provided, it tells you what percentage of the words in the show are in each HSK level (or not in HSK at all)

## Motivation:

I've been learning Chinese through immersion, and one of the major difficulties i've run into is finding content to watch that is at the right level of difficulty for my current level of chinese comprehension.
Ideally, I want to find content that is just slightly beyond my current level of comprehension - not too easy as to not learn anything new, and not too hard as to be completely incomprehensible. 
I created this tool to assist me in this endeavour.
